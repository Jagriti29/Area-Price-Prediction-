## Overview

The Area Price Prediction project aims to provide a tool for predicting real estate prices based on various input features such as location, size, and other relevant factors. This can be particularly useful for real estate agents, potential buyers, and researchers looking to analyze market trends.


## Features

- **Machine Learning Model**: Developed using scikit-learn to predict area prices.
- **Web Application**: Interactive user interface built with Streamlit.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handles missing values, categorical encoding, and feature scaling.

## Usage
 
**Running the Web App**: 

Launch the Streamlit web application to interact with the model.


## Web Application

To start the Streamlit web application, run:

```bash
  streamlit run myapp.py
```

This will launch a local web server where you can interact with the model through a user-friendly interface.



## Model Training

The model is trained using a dataset containing various features related to area prices. The training script includes steps for:

- Data loading
- Data preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, feature scaling)
- Model training (using scikit-learn algorithms)
- Model evaluation (calculating performance metrics)
- Saving the trained model for later use
## Web Application 

The web application allows users to input features and get predictions for area prices. It includes:

- Input from the user
- Display of predicted price
